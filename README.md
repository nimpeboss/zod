# zod

A small learning project demonstrating usage of Zod for schema validation in TypeScript.

## Overview

This repository contains example schemas, validation utilities, and experiments using [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod). It was created to explore runtime validation patterns and TypeScript type inference with Zod.

## Features ✅

- Example schema definitions and compositions
- Type-safe validation and parsing
- Small, focused experiments illustrating Zod usage

## Getting started 🔧

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/nimpeboss/zod.git

2. Install dependencies:

   npm install

3. Build or run the examples:

   npm run build
   npm start

Adjust commands if you prefer a different package manager or workflow.

## Usage 💡

See `src/` for example schemas and `src/index.ts` for basic usage of the provided utilities. Use Zod's parsing/validation methods to validate runtime data and derive TypeScript types.
